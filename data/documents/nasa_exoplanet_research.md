# NASA Exoplanet Research and Detection Methods

## Overview

NASA has been at the forefront of exoplanet discovery and research since the first confirmed detection in 1992. The agency has developed and utilized multiple detection methods to find and characterize planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system.

## Detection Methods

### Transit Method

The transit method, pioneered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, detects planets by measuring the slight dimming of a star when a planet passes in front of it. This method has been incredibly successful, discovering thousands of exoplanets.

**Key Features:**
- Measures periodic dips in stellar brightness
- Provides information about planet size and orbital period
- Most successful method for finding Earth-sized planets
- Can detect planets in habitable zones

**Notable Discoveries:**
- Kepler-452b: "Earth's cousin" in habitable zone
- TRAPPIST-1 system: Seven Earth-sized planets
- Thousands of confirmed exoplanets

### Radial Velocity Method

The radial velocity method measures the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets. This technique provides information about planet masses and orbital characteristics.

**Key Features:**
- Detects stellar motion toward and away from Earth
- Provides mass estimates for planets
- Works well for massive planets close to their stars
- Complementary to transit method

**Instruments:**
- HARPS (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher)
- HIRES (High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer)
- Various ground-based observatories

### Direct Imaging

Direct imaging allows astronomers to see exoplanets directly and study their atmospheres. While challenging, this method provides the most detailed information about exoplanet characteristics.

**Key Features:**
- Captures actual images of exoplanets
- Enables atmospheric composition analysis
- Works best for large, young planets far from their stars
- Provides information about planet temperature and weather

**Notable Examples:**
- HR 8799 system: Multiple directly imaged planets
- Beta Pictoris b: Young giant planet
- Fomalhaut b: Debris disk planet
